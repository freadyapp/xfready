# Fready Chrome Extension
Welcome to the behind-the-scenes of the Fready extension. All code is open-source and you can freely copy it, modify it and do whatever you want with it. It has no license and "its provided as is".

## Many Thanks to:
Fready uses and extends Mozilla's Readability open source project. Huge thanks to everyone who is contributing to that project, Fready wouldn't be so good without it.
We also use a couple of other JavaScript libraries, like Tippy, MouseTrap, MiniHtml and JQuery. Open source rocks!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us! We'd love to talk to you. ❤️
